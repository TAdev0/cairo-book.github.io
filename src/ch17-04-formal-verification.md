# Formal Verification

Formal verification of smart contracts refers to the process of mathematically proving that a smart contract's code behaves exactly as intended under all possible scenarios. It ensures that a contract's implementation correctly fulfills its specification.

Key aspects of formal verification for smart contracts include:
- Specification: Defining precise, unambiguous requirements for the contract's behavior.
- Modeling: Translating the smart contract code into a formal mathematical model.
- Properties: Expressing desired behaviors and safety conditions as mathematical statements.
- Verification: Using automated tools to prove that the model satisfies the specified properties.
  
Formal verification ultimately provides mathematical certainty about the contract's behavior within the verified properties.

This approach is particularly valuable for smart contracts due to their immutable nature and the high stakes often involved in blockchain contracts and applications.
